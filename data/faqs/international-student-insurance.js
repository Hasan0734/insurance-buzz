            public healthcare services in other countries. Many educational
            institutions mandate that students possess a medical insurance plan

          Your journey to Canada is intended to be a transformative experience.
          However, if an unforeseen medical emergency arises, it could entail
          substantial daily medical costs that fall outside the scope of
          Canada's public healthcare system.

          Travel medical insurance can alleviate this potential financial strain

          Each travel medical insurance policy is unique, offering a range of
          options for coverage. Students should primarily consider the following
          key benefits when seeking coverage: emergency medical services
          (including dental care), medical transportation, and repatriation (the
          return of remains to the home country in the event of death abroad).
        </p>
        <p className="text-md">
          Typically, most travel medical insurance policies encompass the
          following:

        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <li className="text-md">

          <li className="text-md">Emergency dental services.</li>
          <li className="text-md">
            Provision of essential medical equipment (such as crutches,
            wheelchairs, slings, braces, etc.).
          </li>
          <li className="text-md">
            Coverage for diagnostic services and laboratory procedures

          <li className="text-md">
            Necessary ground, air, or sea ambulance services.

        <p className="text-md">
          Moreover, student travel medical insurance policies may extend to
          additional non-emergency medical benefits, including:

          Lastly, these policies often incorporate a modest accidental death or
          dismemberment benefit, payable to the insured or their beneficiary in
          the event of dismemberment or loss of life, respectively.

        Does student travel insurance provide coverage for pre-existing

        <p className="text-md">
          Typically, most student travel medical insurance policies do not
          automatically cover pre-existing medical conditions. Given that most
          student applicants are relatively young, pre-existing conditions are
          not typically a primary concern when they apply for coverage.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md">
          However, if you are a student with a pre-existing medical condition,
          it is crucial to secure coverage that takes your condition into
          consideration. If your condition is stable, it is generally easier to
          obtain coverage.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md">
          In many cases, if you have been symptom-free and have not received a
          diagnosis or treatment for a pre-existing medical condition for a
          period ranging from 90 to 180 days before the policy's effective date,
          it may not be classified as a pre-existing condition during the
          coverage period.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md">
          Always review the policy wording for specifics and to determine if
          your medical condition would be covered during trips outside your home
          country.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md">
          During the underwriting process, certain conditions may be excluded
          from your travel medical insurance coverage. Pre-existing condition
          exclusions can encompass conditions such as:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <li className="text-md">Cancer</li>
          <li className="text-md">Heart disease</li>
          <li className="text-md">Diabetes</li>
          <li className="text-md">High blood pressure</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-md">
          They may also encompass relatively mild conditions for which you have
          been prescribed medication, such as:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <li className="text-md">Sleep apnea</li>
          <li className="text-md">Anxiety and/or depression</li>
          <li className="text-md">Bipolar disorder</li>
          <li className="text-md">Other mental health conditions</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-md">
          Insurance providers evaluate the specific state of your illness or
          condition to assess the risk associated with the pre-existing
          condition and make their determination accordingly for your travel
          insurance plan.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md">
          Some providers offer policies that cover pre-existing conditions,
          although the premium is typically higher to account for the increased
          risk.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md">
          Individuals should request clarification regarding any limitations and
          restrictions on pre-existing medical conditions, as well as any past
          tests and treatments they may have undergone.
