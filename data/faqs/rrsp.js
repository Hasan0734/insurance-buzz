          A Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is a government-registered
          savings arrangement in Canada designed for retirement savings
          purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          By contributing funds to an RRSP, you benefit from its
          "tax-advantaged" nature, which implies that the funds you put in are
          not subject to taxation in the year of contribution. Subsequently, any
          investment income derived from investments held within the RRSP can
          grow without being taxed, as long as the funds remain within the RRSP
          until withdrawal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contributions made to an RRSP are eligible for tax deduction, allowing
          you to deduct these amounts from your tax return for the current year.
          This deduction has the potential to decrease your overall tax burden,
          providing potential tax savings.

    ),
    children: (
      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>
          Within an RRSP, a broad spectrum of investments can be held,
          contingent on the specific plan type. This includes assets such as
          stocks, bonds, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), and mutual
          funds. The investment income that accumulates from these holdings
          enjoys tax-deferred status within the RRSP until the point of
          withdrawal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount you can contribute each year is determined by a maximum
          limit called your RRSP contribution or deduction limit. For the year
          2023, your RRSP contribution limit is either 18% of your earned income
          from 2022 or $30,780, whichever figure is lower. This value is then
          adjusted by considering any previously unused contribution room and
          subtracting pension adjustments.

          There isn't a specific minimum age requirement for opening an RRSP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, certain financial institutions might stipulate that
          customers should have reached the age of majority. You have the option
          to establish and contribute to an RRSP until the end of the year you
          turn 71, provided you are a Canadian resident, possess earned income,
          and file a tax return. For more insights into making contributions to
          an RRSP, refer to our comprehensive guide on RRSP Contribution Rules.

          The ideal age can differ based on individual circumstances. Generally,
          though, the sooner, the better! Commencing your investment journey for
          retirement at an early stage can potentially grant you the advantages
          of tax-deferred compound interest, contingent on the type of
          investment you hold.

          You have the flexibility to initiate a withdrawal from your RRSP at
          any time, provided your funds are not held within a locked-in plan.
          However, it's important to note that withdrawals typically count as
          part of your income and are subject to taxation in the year of
          withdrawal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ordinarily, a portion of the withdrawn amount is withheld and
          forwarded to the government as an advance payment of the income tax
          due for that year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on your taxable income for the withdrawal year, it might be
          advantageous to delay withdrawals until a year with a lower taxable
          income.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, unlike withdrawals from a tax-free savings account
          (TFSA), funds taken out from an RRSP are not reinstated to your
          contribution room during the year following the withdrawal.
