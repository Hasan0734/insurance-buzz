            A super visa functions as a unique type of visa, designed to enable the parents and grandparents of either Canadian citizens or permanent residents to visit them. In contrast to the usual visitor's visa, which permits a stay of up to 6 months in Canada, a super visa operates differently. This visa is categorized as a multi-entry permit, affording visitors the opportunity to remain for a maximum of 5 years and granting them the flexibility to make multiple entries during this period. Moreover, those holding a super visa have the option to request a 2-year extension. Upon being granted a super visa, its validity extends for a span of 10 years.

            Indeed, super visa applicants must have super visa insurance. A fundamental aspect of the super visa program is ensuring that visitors do not place a financial burden on the public healthcare system or their sponsoring family member. This insurance serves as proof that you possess adequate coverage in the event of a health emergency during your extended stay.

However, it's important to note that you may need a higher coverage amount, as the policy must, at the very least, cover healthcare expenses, hospitalization costs, and travel expenses if your visiting family members must return home while still receiving medical treatment.

            Indeed, super visa insurance will extend coverage to pre-existing conditions or medical conditions that were pre-existing before your application, provided they meet the criteria of stability. Stability means that your condition has not:

            Many Canadian insurance providers stipulate that your pre-existing health condition must meet these stability criteria for a minimum period of 180 days, roughly equivalent to 6 months, to be eligible for coverage under your Canadian super visa health insurance plan.

            Yes, you have the option to cancel super visa insurance. However, cancellations are relatively infrequent because this type of insurance is a prerequisite for obtaining the visa itself.

            Consider this scenario: Your super visa application has been approved, and you are currently utilizing that visa to stay in Canada. In such a case, canceling the insurance would also result in the cancellation of your visa, which is typically not a desired outcome.

            Nevertheless, if you find yourself needing to depart Canada earlier than originally planned, and you haven't made use of your insurance plan, there is an opportunity to cancel the policy and potentially receive a partial refund. It's important to be aware that a cancellation fee may apply in this situation.
