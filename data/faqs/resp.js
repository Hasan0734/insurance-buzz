          A registered education savings plan (RESP) is an agreement established
          between an individual (referred to as the subscriber) and an entity or
          individual (known as the promoter).
        </p>
        <p>
          Within this agreement, the subscriber designates one or multiple
          beneficiaries (who are prospective students) and commits to
          contributing funds on their behalf. In return, the promoter commits to
          disbursing educational assistance payments (EAPs) to these
          beneficiaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among RESP options, family plans are the sole type permitting
          subscribers to name more than a single beneficiary. Each beneficiary
          within a family plan must maintain a biological or adopted
          relationship with every living subscriber or maintain such a
          connection with a deceased original subscriber.

            savings. These grants have no impact on your RESP contribution room.
            For instance, through the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG), the
            government matches 20% of your contributions, up to $2,500 annually.
            This match extends up to a maximum lifetime grant amount of $7,200

        <p>
          A RESP plan is initiated by an individual known as the "subscriber,"
          who exclusively holds the right to make contributions and withdrawals
          within the plan. This subscriber can set up a plan for a single or
          multiple "beneficiaries," depending on the RESP type. In the context
          of an "individual plan," a beneficiary could be your child,
          grandchild, niece, nephew, or a family friend. Conversely, a "family
          plan" confines RESP beneficiaries to individuals connected to you by
          blood (or legal adoption), encompassing your children, stepchildren,
          grandchildren, and siblings.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there exist three types of RESPs (Individual, Family, and
          Group), TD exclusively offers Individual and Family plans. Both
          options serve to cover the expenses tied to post-secondary education.
          To learn more, consult the list of eligible post-secondary educational
          institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          An array of investments, including cash, GICs, and mutual funds, can
          be held within the RESP, facilitating tax-deferred growth. Your
          contributions to the RESP have the potential to be matched by the
          federal government through the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG),
          equating to a 20% match on your contributions up to $2,500 annually. A
          RESP can remain active for a maximum of 35 years, featuring a lifetime
          contribution cap of $50,000 for each beneficiary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon your beneficiary's enrollment in an eligible post-secondary
          institution, when you are prepared to withdraw funds for educational
          purposes, payments can be made from these accumulated funds. It's
          essential to remember that investments within the plan experience
          tax-deferred growth and are subjected to taxation upon withdrawal. For
          more insights, peruse our comprehensive overview of RESP withdrawal
          regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In cases where the beneficiary opts not to pursue post-secondary
          education, alternatives include transferring the plan to another
          beneficiary within a family plan or transferring the RESP to an RRSP,
          contingent upon specific limitations. To acquire more information,

          Contributions made to a RESP are not eligible for tax deductions.
          However, your funds have the potential to experience tax-deferred
          growth during their tenure within the plan. Upon withdrawal of funds
          for educational purposes, taxation is applied to the investment income
          and government grants received, not on the contributions funded from
          your resources. These sums are subject to taxation for the student,
          generally resulting in minimal or no tax liability, as students
          typically fall within the lower tax bracket. To delve deeper, refer to

          Exceeding your contributions to a RESP entails tax consequences. Each
          subscriber associated with the beneficiary is responsible for a 1%
          monthly tax on their proportion of the surplus contribution (if it
          remains unwithdrawn by the month's end). This tax must be settled
          within 90 days following the conclusion of the year in which the
          surplus contribution arises. Payments directed to a RESP through the
          CESG or any Provincial Education Savings Programs do not factor into
          the assessment of whether a beneficiary has exceeded their
          contribution limit.
