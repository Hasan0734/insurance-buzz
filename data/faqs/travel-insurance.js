          Visitors insurance encompasses various categories of travel insurance
          coverage designed to offer protection during a visit to Canada. This
          insurance serves to reimburse or cover unforeseen out-of-pocket
          expenses and other non-refundable costs associated with your journey.

              This facet covers supplementary expenses in cases of flight
              delays, cancellations, the need to curtail your trip prematurely

              Permanent life insurance plans typically necessitate higher
              premiums due to the fact that they provide coverage throughout
              your entire lifetime.

              Travel medical insurance provides assistance in covering medical
              expenses should you fall ill or sustain injuries during your
              travels. It also aids in defraying the costs associated with

          A super visa functions as a unique type of visa, designed to enable
          the parents and grandparents of either Canadian citizens or permanent
          residents to visit them. In contrast to the usual visitor's visa,
          which permits a stay of up to 6 months in Canada, a super visa
          operates differently. This visa is categorized as a multi-entry
          permit, affording visitors the opportunity to remain for a maximum of
          5 years and granting them the flexibility to make multiple entries
          during this period. Moreover, those holding a super visa have the
          option to request a 2-year extension. Upon being granted a super visa,
