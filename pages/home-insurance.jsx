          <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>Points to Remember</h2>
          <ul className='list-disc ml-6'>
            <li className='text-md'>
              <b>Coverage Adequacy:</b> Ensure that your home insurance policy
              provides adequate coverage for your property and possessions.
              Review the limits and consider factors like the replacement cost
              of your home and the value of your belongings to ensure you have
              sufficient protection in case of a loss.
            </li>
            <li className='text-md'>
              <b> Additional Coverages: </b>Understand the optional coverages
              and endorsements available with your policy. Depending on your
              circumstances, you may want to consider additional protection for
              specific risks such as flood, earthquake, or sewer backup. Assess
              your needs and add these coverages as necessary.
            </li>
            <li className='text-md'>
              <b>Documentation and Inventory:</b> Maintain a thorough inventory
              of your belongings and keep records of valuable items. This
              documentation is crucial in the event of a claim, as it helps
              ensure you receive proper compensation for lost or damaged items.
              Consider keeping a digital or physical inventory, including
              photographs and receipts.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These three points highlight the importance of adequate coverage,
            understanding optional coverages, and maintaining proper
            documentation, which are essential aspects of securing the right
            home insurance in Canada for your specific needs.
